# Assignment Ch. 3 - DataScience (Startup Campus)

## Target Portfolio 
I could do data visualization, data modeling, and KPI Metric
Comparison/Explanation

## Background 
HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data
visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to create their
own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM
courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of
Business. He created this data set.

## Dataset

## Tasks 
1. Do some multiple aggregations using Pandas.
2. Perform EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables
are related to the termination of an employee's employment.
3. Create data visualization according to EDA Steps. Give an insight from this step.
4. Perform Machine Learning modeling to predict employee termination.
5. Answer questions:
6.    Is there any relationship between who a person works for (their manager) and their performance score?
7.    What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a low ratio of termination?
