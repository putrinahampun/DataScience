# Assignment Ch. 3 - DataScience (Startup Campus)

## Target Portfolio 
Students could do data visualization, data modeling, and KPI Metric
Comparison/Explanation

## Background 
HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data
visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to create their
own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM
courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of
Business. He created this data set.

## Dataset

ataset_v14.csv

## Tasks 
1. Answer multiple aggregations questions using Pandas.
2. Perform EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables
are related to the termination of an employee's employment. (Most
reasons, by department, by gender, etc.) Create data visualization
according to EDA Steps (minimum 5 visualizations). Give us an
insight from this step.
3. Perform Machine Learning modeling to predict employee
termination.
4. Answer this question:
    a. Is there any relationship between who a person works for
    (their manager) and their performance score?
    b. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a
    low ratio of termination?
